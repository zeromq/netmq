    /// other end of the PairSocket which calling code would receive by using the
    /// Actor classes various ReceiveXXX() methods
    ///
    /// This is a VERY simple protocol but it just demonstrates what you would need
    /// to do to implement your own Shim handler
    ///
    /// The only things you MUST do is to follow this example for handling
    /// a few things
    ///
    /// 1. Bad commands should always send the following message
    ///    "Error: invalid message to actor"
    /// 2. When we receive a command from the actor telling us to exit the pipeline we should immediately
    ///    break out of the while loop, and dispose of the shim socket
    /// 3. When an Exception occurs you should send that down the wire to Actors calling code
